 * Project 3 class starts by taking in a file named Countries3.csv, parsing out the information and creating Country (using Country class) objects out of each line from the file.
 * From these Country objects a stack (using Stack class) is created using COVID death rate as a parameter. Only Country objects with a death rate of greater than or equal to twenty but less than three-hundred and fifty make it into the stack. The stack is then printed.
 * A priority que is then created by popping each country object from the stack and inserting them into the queue one at a time. The priority queue is then printed.
 * After the stack and queue are filled, the user is prompted repeatedly to enter a number corresponding to an action on a menu, until 3 is entered, 
 * then the program will terminate.
